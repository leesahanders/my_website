Very specific learning for the day but if you are trying to run pulumi-with-ansible IAC and in a world of ssh key pain this bypasses the ssh-agent: 

Pulumi.yaml
```
  keypath: "~/.ssh/lisa-eastus.pem"
```

__main__.py
```
pulumi.export('keypath', config.require("keypath"))
```

playbook.yml
```
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: "{{ keypath }}"
```

Or just add things properly to your ssh-agent (even better, start using the config): 

```
# Set permissions 
chmod -R 400 ~/.ssh/mykey.pem # 600 is also fine

# Add keys to ssh-agent 
ssh-agent -s
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add ~/.ssh/mykeyaws.pem
ssh-add ~/.ssh/mykeyazure.pem
```
