# Overview 

Microsoft Entra ID (Entra ID) is a common authentication choice among customers for its ability to support Single Sign-On (SSO). This guide will show an opinionated setup and configuration of Posit Connect and Posit Workbench with Entra ID.

# Pre requisites 

- Succesful installation of Workbench and/or Connect 
- SSH access to the servers 
- Valid SSL certificate configurations with verified access over HTTPS for Workbench and/or Connect
  - If an external proxy or load balancer is used, the front-door address must be configured with an SSL certificate.
- Administrative access to Entra ID with the ability to create and modify applications
- Posit Connect will need WebSockets enabled (on by default) to handle redirects.

If SCIM for user provisioning is needed (note that this page reviews JIT, not SCIM), then the additional requirements will need to be satisfied: 

- Azure requires a secure connection, the certificate must be a Certificate Authority (CA) signed certificate (cannot be self-signed)
- Networking access between the Posit servers and the Entra ID service with port 443 (for HTTPS) open.

If configuring with Slurm then additional networking considerations will need to be taken into account. Slurm configuration is documented [here](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/admin/integration/launcher-slurm.html). 

To configure authentication with either OpenID or SAML, both the software address and an additional path, if being used, must be known. If there is not an additional path that is being served from then omit that from the below instructions. 

# EntraID Set Up Overview

The steps needed to set up EntraID are: 

- Create and configure the EntraID application for Connect
- Create and configure the EntraID application for Workbench

For Workbench with SCIM, there would be an additional step to create and configure the Entra ID user provisioning application if desired.

> Note: EntraID has a notion of app registration and enterprise application. The app registration is used to register external access for an application. The enterprise application is tenant specific and is what controls authentication and (optionally) user provisioning. The order of creation doesn't matter but them being associated with each other does. This guide shows starting with the application registration (the enterprise application will be auto created) since there are already pre-developed templates that can be used. The issue that can be encountered is that Microsoft tries to hide menu's to be helpful. 
> 
> If the provisioning pane isn't visible from the enterprise application then the app registration should be deleted and the creation should be re-started but starting with the enterprise application and the option to "integrate with an un-listed app". 

# Posit Connect Set Up Overview

Connect user access is to the hosted web domain. Users exist as users in the software but do not need access to underlying Linux resources.

The steps needed to set up Connect are: 

- Encrypt secrets
- Configure authentication in the Connect config file `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`
- Restart Connect 
- Test and verify operation

# Posit Workbench Set Up Overview 

In addition to access to the hosted web domain, Workbench users need to be provisioned as linux users with a home directory. 

The steps needed to set up Workbench are: 

- Encrypt secrets
- Configure authentication in the Workbench config file ``
- Configure user provisioning by enabling home directory creation 
- Configure nss switch and the workbench pam auth profile 
- Configure user provisioning in the Workbench config file ``
- Restart Workbench
- Test and verify operation

# Choices Overview 

## Authentication Protocol: SAML vs OpenID / Oauth

Both SAML and OpenID/Oauth support SSO and are recommended over other methods since it leverages the full capablity of using an enterprise authentication provider. 

Oauth is typically preferred as the stronger choice and the gold standard for secure authentication currently. This is due to its use of tokens. Importantly they are short-lived, usually expiring after an hour, so the risk of exposure and abuse is much lower than other options. 

However, if there is an existing Active Directory (AD) service or LDAP service and a knowledgeable IT team for those services than that can also work. 

This guide will show the steps for Oauth configured authentication as it narrowly beats out the other options as a general recommendation, but SAML is also perfectly valid as a choice. SAML configuration is documented [here](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/authentication/saml-based/entra-id-saml/) for Connect and [here](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/admin/authenticating_users/saml_sso.html) for Workbench. 

## User Provisioning Method: SCIM vs JIT 

JIT provisioning offers distinct advantages by (1) creating user accounts on-demand, removing the need for pre-provisioning users, and (2) reducing the upfront setup and ongoing maintenance typically associated with a full SCIM integration or managing traditional directory syncs like LDAP/SSSD/Active Directory. 

However, if your existing method already meets your needs for user lifecycle management or if you require pre-provisioning capabilities or complex role mapping, then a different user provisioning approach should be considered. SCIM would be a good option to consider for its ability to to create and manage assignemnt of users to group if that is needed for downstream workflows. 

This guide will show JIT provisioning as it is much easier to set up but SCIM is also perfectly valid as a choice. SCIM provisioning for Workbench is documented [here](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/admin/user_provisioning/azure.html) and [here](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/admin/user_provisioning/managing_users.html). 

# Steps

## Configure the user authentication applications in Microsoft Entra ID

One application will need to be created per product needing authentication. 

When an app registration is created, EntraID will automatically create an Enterprise application. Both of these together will allow set up of authentication and managing user access. 

Go to `App registrations` -> `New registration`. Give it a name like "Posit-Workbench-Production" or "Posit-Connect-Production" and fill in the `Web` redirect URI. The redirect URI should be the https address for your software or the frontdoor of the proxy/load balancer with an additional callback endpoint: 

- Workbench redirect URI:  The endpoint responsible for handling this callback is located at `/openid/callback`. For example, if your Workbench server is hosted at `https://workbench.posit.example.com/` the callback URL will be `https://workbench.posit.example.com/openid/callback`. 
- Connect redirect URI: The endpoint responsible for handling this callback from the OP is located at `/__login__/callback`.  For example, if your Connect server is hosted at `https://connect.posit.example.com/` the callback URL will be `https://connect.posit.example.com/__login__/callback`. 

Make sure any whitespace has been removed. A trailing whitespace will result in an "invalid url" error. 

Go to `Overview` -> `Endpoints` and copy the value in `OpenID Connect metadata document` for later. 

Go to the enterprise app blade (that can be found under the overview page under `Managed application in local directory`) `managed application in local directory ` . Under `Manage` -> `Properties` -> make sure that `Assignment required?` is set to `yes`. Assign users by going to `Manage` -> `Users and groups` -> `Add user/group`. 

Go to `Manage` -> `Certificates & secrets` and create a `client secret`. Copy the field of `Value` for later, this will be your `client-secret`. 

Return to the `Overview` page and copy the field of `Application (client) ID` for later as well, this will modified to be your `client-id`. 

## Posit Connect 

### Encrypt secrets

The Connect utility [rscadmin](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/appendix/cli/#rscadmin) can be used to encrypt secrets like postgres passwords or Oauth client-secrets. 

```bash
# Call the function 
sudo rscadmin encrypt-config-value 

# If the command hasn't been aliased use the full path
sudo /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/rscadmin encrypt-config-value
```

### Configure Posit Connect

Configure Connect to use OpenID by modifying the config file `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg` according to the [Connect Admin Guide section on Oauth2](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/authentication/oauth2-openid-based/entra-id-openid-connect/)

```{.bash filename="/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg"}
; /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg

[Authentication]
Provider = "oauth2"

[OAuth2]
ClientId = "example-example-example-example-example"
ClientSecret = "example"
OpenIDConnectIssuer = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0"
RequireUsernameClaim = true
; Enable this for a better user experience, unless
; managing a large number of groups is a concern:
;GroupsAutoProvision = true

; When troubleshooting an OAuth2 problem, more verbose logging
; is produced by uncommenting the following line:
;Logging = true
```

### Restart Posit Connect

Restart Connect and check the status and logs for any issues. 

```bash
# Restart the service 
sudo systemctl restart rstudio-connect

# Check the status
sudo systemctl status rstudio-connect

# Check the most recent logs
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/rstudio/rstudio-connect.log | grep error*
```

## Posit Workbench

### Encrypt secrets 

Encrypt the value of your client secret following the steps [documented encryption steps in the Workbench Admin Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/admin/hardening/encryption.html#step-re-encrypt-configuration-values). 

```bash
sudo rstudio-server encrypt-password
```

### Configure Posit Workbench for user authentication

Edit the `/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf` file to use openid. 

```{.bash filename="/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf"}
auth-openid=1
auth-openid-issuer="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0"
```

The `auth-openid-issuer` value will be "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0". 

Create a file `/etc/rstudio/openid-client-secret` that will include the parameters for the encrypted client secret and the client-id. 

```{.bash filename="/etc/rstudio/openid-client-secret"}
client-id="example-example-example-example-example"
client-secret="example"
```

The `client id` is the `Application (client) ID` from EntraID. The `client secret` is the encrypted value from above that came from the `Client Secret Value` field in EntraID. 

Protect the `openid-client-secret` file to restrict access: 

```bash
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/rstudio/openid-client-secret
```

### Configure User Provisioning 

Workbench requires users to have local or networked system accounts. These need to be linux users complete with home directories. 

You must set up local system accounts manually, or using network services such as LDAP or Active Directory, and then map authenticating users to these accounts.

Follow the steps in the [how to guide for setting up JIT](https://github.com/rstudio/docs.rstudio.com/blob/ead3bd8cc2b0d03a32de04a14b7d3f791447191e/how-to-guides/guides/configure-pwb-jit.md). 

#### Release valve: Manual provisioning 

If you don't have many users and don't expect many changes in usership than manually provisioning might be the easiest choice. Similarly, if there are issues with the other provisioning methods this is always an option. 

The key is that the username must match the prefered_username claim coming from Entra ID (or be a claim coming from Entra ID that Workbench can be configured to use with the `auth-openid-username-claim=` parameter in `/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf`). 

```bash
sudo useradd myusername@mycompany.com -m
```

#### System dependencies 

System dependencies should be installed as the root user. While not always required, completing the install as root will make things go smoother. 

##### Ubuntu / Debian

Follow the steps in the [how to guide for setting up JIT](https://github.com/rstudio/docs.rstudio.com/blob/ead3bd8cc2b0d03a32de04a14b7d3f791447191e/how-to-guides/guides/configure-pwb-jit.md). 

```bash
# Install the PAM mkhomedir module if not already installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libpam-modules

# Edit the PAM configuration to add a line to automatically create user home directories in common-session
echo "session required pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel/ umask=0022" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/common-session
```

##### RHEL / Rocky

Follow the steps in the [how to guide for setting up JIT](https://github.com/rstudio/docs.rstudio.com/blob/ead3bd8cc2b0d03a32de04a14b7d3f791447191e/how-to-guides/guides/configure-pwb-jit.md). 

```bash
# Install required packages
sudo dnf install -y oddjob-mkhomedir authselect

# Enable the oddjobd service for home directory creation
sudo systemctl enable --now oddjobd.service

# Enable the home directory creation feature
authselect enable-feature with-mkhomedir
authselect apply-changes
```

#### Configure the NSS module

Follow the steps in the [how to guide for setting up JIT](https://github.com/rstudio/docs.rstudio.com/blob/ead3bd8cc2b0d03a32de04a14b7d3f791447191e/how-to-guides/guides/configure-pwb-jit.md). 

##### Ubuntu / Debian

Modify the `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file to include pwb before sssd (if present) otherwise last in each row. For example it might look something like this (remember to only add pwb, no other parameters): 

```{.bash filename="/etc/nsswitch.conf"}
# Modify the passwd, group, and shadow lines to include pwb at the end
passwd:         files systemd pwb
group:          files systemd pwb
shadow:         files pwb sssd
```

##### RHEL / Rocky

Create an authselect profile: 

```bash
sudo authselect create-profile pwb --base-on=minimal
```

Modify the `/etc/authselect/custom/pwb/nsswitch.conf` file to include pwb before sssd (if present) otherwise last in each row. For example it might look something like this (remember to only add pwb, no other parameters): 

```{.bash filename="/etc/authselect/custom/pwb/nsswitch.conf"}
# Modify the passwd, group, and shadow lines to include pwb at the end
passwd:         files systemd pwb
group:          files systemd pwb
shadow:         files pwb sssd
```

Once saved update the profile with: 

```bash
# Enable the custom profile with mkhomedir support
sudo authselect select custom/pwb with-mkhomedir
sudo authselect apply-changes
```

#### Disable NSCD caching

Follow the steps in the [how to guide for setting up JIT](https://github.com/rstudio/docs.rstudio.com/blob/ead3bd8cc2b0d03a32de04a14b7d3f791447191e/how-to-guides/guides/configure-pwb-jit.md). 

NSCD Caching can cause issues with Workbench's user provisioning process, and so must be disabled by following the steps below. Disabling these caches should not affect system performance, as Workbench user provisioning implements its own caching mechanism.

If NSCD caching utilities aren't installed then continue to the next step. 

```
# Add or modify the following lines
enable-cache passwd no
enable-cache group no
```

#### Configure JIT Provisioning for Posit Workbench 

Follow the steps in the [how to guide for setting up JIT](https://github.com/rstudio/docs.rstudio.com/blob/ead3bd8cc2b0d03a32de04a14b7d3f791447191e/how-to-guides/guides/configure-pwb-jit.md). 

Update the `/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf` config file to enable user provisioning with JIT: 

```{.bash filename="/etc/rstudio/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf"}
# Add the following lines
user-provisioning-enabled=1
user-provisioning-register-on-first-login=1

# Add the following line to enable PAM sessions
auth-pam-sessions-enabled=1

# Optional: Configure starting UID (default is 1000)
#user-provisioning-start-uid=1000

# Optional: Set custom home directory path (default is /home)
#user-homedir-path=/mnt/home
```

### Restart Posit Workbench

Restart Workbench and check the status and logs for any issues. 

```bash
# Restart the service 
sudo rstudio-server restart
sudo rstudio-launcher restart

# Check the status
sudo systemctl status rstudio-server
sudo systemctl status rstudio-launcher

# Check the most recent logs
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/rstudio/rstudio-server/rserver.log | grep error*
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/rstudio/launcher/rstudio-launcher.log
```

## Troubleshooting 

In case of issues you can reach out to our [support team](https://docs.posit.co/support.html).Please make sure to include a copy of your diagnostic as well as all error messages and screenshots of your configured applications in EntraID. 

### EntraID group issues

EntraID limits group membership to 150. If a user is a member of more than 150 groups than their group list will be concatenated, potentially missing important ones that are needed inside Connect or Workbench.

## Changing authentication providers 

If you are updating an existing Posit Workbench or Posit Connect to now use Entra ID as the authentication provider there are a couple additional tips that are useful to know. 

Always take a backup and/or perform changes in a staging environment prior to making updates to production in order to minimize downtime. 

### Posit Connect

Refer to the [changing authentication providers page](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/authentication/migration/) (talks about how to use the usermanager tool to align users). 

Make sure that Connect has email configured and it is able to successfully send emails. This is needed so that in the case of something going wrong an admin can remote onto the server and make themselves an administrator. You'll also want to know about the [Connect CLI command](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/appendix/cli/) in the case of troubleshooting, look for "Promote the user john to an administrator role". 

### Posit Workbench 

User mapping on Workbench is less of a challenge than on Connect. As long as the user matches the same username they will be able to log in and access the files from their home directory. In the case of changing authentication providers and the usenrame changes then the contents of home directories will need to be migrated from the old usernames to the new usernames.
