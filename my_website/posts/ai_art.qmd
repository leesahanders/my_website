## AI Generated Art

AI isn't a new concept. Using AI's to generate art isn't a new concept. Having that available as app that actually creates some pretty fun results is pretty new.

As someone whose artistic ambitions always are greater than my actual ability, this has been a surprisingly fun and rewarding technology to play around with.

The two that I can recommend are:

-   My first AI art generating app (5 free pieces of art per day): <https://www.starryai.com/>

-   Doesn't require log in (5 free pieces of art per day, however using incognito mode or edge counts as a separate user for 15 pieces of art per day): <https://creator.nightcafe.studio/>

-   No limit to number of pieces, landscapes only: <https://www.wombo.art/>

There are a bunch more I'm looking forward to trying: <https://www.unite.ai/10-best-ai-art-generators/#:~:text=Another%20one%20of%20the%20best,trained%20with%20millions%20of%20images>
