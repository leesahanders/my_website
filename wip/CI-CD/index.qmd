Content can be published to Connect from a CI/CD pipeline by utilizing the [Connect Server API](https://docs.posit.co/connect/api). A CI/CD pipeline can utilize the API directly, use a Posit-created [GitHub Action](https://github.com/rstudio/actions/tree/main/connect-publish), or use a package in Python/R ([rsconnect-python](https://github.com/rstudio/rsconnect-python) or [connectapi](https://github.com/rstudio/connectapi)).

Each page in this section has detailed examples of how each CI/CD system can be utilized to deploy content to Connect.

| CI/CD System | 
|----|
| [Azure Pipelines](azure-pipelines/)      |
| [Bitbucket Pipelines](bitbucket-pipelines/)      |
| [GitHub Actions](github-actions/)     |
| [Gitlab CI/CD](gitlab-ci-cd/)       | 
| [Jenkins](jenkins/)       |
